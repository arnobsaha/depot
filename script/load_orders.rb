    This will create 100 orders with no line items in them. Feel free to modify the
script to create line items if you are so inclined. Note that this code does all
this work in one transaction. This isnâ€™t precisely required for this activity but
does speed up the processing.

*** Important : Note that we donâ€™t have any require statements or initialization to open or close
the database. We will allow Rails to take care of this for us

Order.transaction do
  (1..100).each do |i|
    Order.create(:name => "Customer #{i}", :address => "#{i} Main Street",
                 :email => "customer-#{i}@example.com", :pay_type => "Check")
  end
