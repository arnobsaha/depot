# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ :name => 'Chicago' }, { :name => 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(:name => 'Emanuel', :city => cities.first)

*** Be warned: this seeds.rb script removes existing data from the products table before loading in
the new data. You might not want to run it if youâ€™ve just spent several hours
typing your own data into your application!

To populate your products table with test data, simply run the following com-
mand:
      depot> rake db:seed
