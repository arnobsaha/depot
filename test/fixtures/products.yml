# Read about fixtures at http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Fixtures.html

#In the world of Rails, a test fixture is simply a specification of the initial con-
#tents of a model (or models) under test. If, for example, we want to ensure that
#our products table starts off with known data at the start of every unit test, we
#can specify those contents in a fixture, and Rails will take care of the rest.
